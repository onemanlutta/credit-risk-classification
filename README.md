# credit-risk-classification
This analysis aims to build and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts the creditworthiness of borrowers based on historical lending data from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to determine the credit risk of borrowers by classifying loans as either healthy (0) or high-risk (1).
